/**
 * Pangram is a sentence that has each letter of alphabet
 * There are two ways to approach this check:
 *    1. Create a hash table of each character occurence.
 *    2. filter each character of the sentence across string with all
 *        alphabets and if the length of this filter is 0 then the given sentence is pangram
